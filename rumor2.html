            The students are really aggressive. I just can’t make any difference 
            between this School and a Prison…Is this 2020? Or 1970? I just can’t 
            believe it! The English lessons and homework are EASY. Now you are 
            thinking okay which class is this? 7th class…

        <p class="schoolsarebad2Description">
            “See? This is why everybody is stupid in this country” - said a street-man.
            “We should protest for better schools!” - Says a 4-child Mom.
            “If you learn in a better school and you get a better job that’s good but the problem is with this city is that if you have another opinion that you are fired…” - Says a Mexican cashier.
            “There is nothing we could do for this city… Hopefully Isold would try to change this country…. I voted at him so he better be a good President.” - Says an anonymous guy.
            “Pavilion is better with schools but the community is not the best. I mean the Arabians should be more friendly because if they are going to continue like this then they are going to end up like their parents!” - An 80 years old angry guy.
