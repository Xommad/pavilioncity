                    A war is about to begin. Isold Voigt ("Ice battle") who took the place 
            of Ursel. So who is Isold? Isold is a ex-president of Lewood. Is this
            good? Yes. He is an expert.  What are the citizens think about him? 
            They hope that he can make this city better than this. What war? A
            war between the rebels and the prayers. We found out that the Lost
            Heights cartel supports the rebels with guns. Is this good? For the
            rebels? Yes. For the Prayers? No. And for us? No! Because this means 
            the streets are not going to be safe. Hopefully we are not going to  
            wake up to gun shots. There is no supporter on the prayers site yet.
            What if the war is really gonna be rough? What should we do?
